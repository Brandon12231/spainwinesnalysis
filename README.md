Motivation According to a recent trend, the Spanish wine market is experiencing a steady decline beginning in 2022. Based on preliminary research, this was due to inefificient supply chain management and lack of understanding of the demand for various categories of wine. Although people's preferences for wine vary greatly when compared to other beverages, we hope to provide valuable insights and recommendations to distributors through this project.

**Objective:**

Our objective is to understand the wine description metrics' influence on the item's perceived value and further provide insights on the high performing characteristics by analyzing a dataset that contains information on 7500 different types of wines.

**Target End Users:**

We aim our study to be helpful to distributors or resellers (those who inherit Spanish wine bottles from wineries and want to sell them) decide to take on new wine products or set their prices. Furthermore, new entrants can use this analysis to get a sense of the market before deciding on the specifications and types of wine with which they want to work.

Report Summary After research about the key factors wine distributors and resellers are seeking, we analyzed the data keeping the criteria in mind. We found a few trends we believe would be useful for them. Based on these trends and information about the wine supply chain, we've provided recommendations on which wineries are the most profitable, which wines have more scope, and which varieties they should put a hold on. We've also analysed the consumer response for different categories that would be very helpful to them.

**Raw Data Profile:**

The dataset contains information on 7500 different types of wines on Kaggle that are essentially categorized by the winery from which they were sourced, the product's name, the year in which the grapes used to make the wine were harvested, the type of red wine, and two aspects of the flavor of the wine, body and acidity. The dataset also has two columns to help understand the feedback received.
